        Of the 38.5 million people living in Canada, just over 5% identify as indigenous. <br />
        Of those, more than half identify as part of the First Nations communities, with the rest identifying as part of the Métis or Inuit communities. <br />
        Only a small percentage of Canadians are considered Inuit; they make up 0.227% of the total population or about 4% of the indigenous population. <br />

    <h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-family:'Oswald'">Number of Indigenous Individuals in Canadian Provinces</h2>

        <p style="font-size:16px; font-family:'Oswald'">
        Indigenous people comprise larger percentages of the northern provinces, making up more than half of the Nunavut and Northwest Territories <br /> 
        population compared to less than 10% of southern provinces such as Ontario and Nova Scotia. <br /> 
        The bulk of First Nations and Métis people live in the southern provinces, with First Nations communities centered around <br />
        Quebec and Ontario and Métis communities located more to the west in provinces such as Ontario and Alberta. <br />
        The Inuit population exists mainly to the east, especially in the northernmost province of Nunavut.

    <h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-family:'Oswald'">Mental Health and Food Insecurity in Canadian Indigenous Population</h2>

        <p style='font-size: 16px; font-style:Helvetica'>
        Mental health shows a positive correlation with food insecurity in both males and females. <br />
        Indigenous groups in general have both higher food insecurity rates and worse mental health. <br />
        Of the indigenous groups, Métis communities show slightly lower food insecurity rates and slightly better mental health in both genders. <br />
        The Inuit serve as an outlier in that they have much higher food insecurity rates than any other indigenous group, yet are less likely to have poor mental health. <br />
        In general, males from all groups have less food insecurity and better mental health outcomes than females.<br />
