								Of the 38.5 million people living in Canada, just over 5% identify as indigenous. <br />
								Of those, more than half identify as part of the First Nations communities, <br />
								with the rest identifying as part of the Métis or Inuit communities. <br />
								Only a small percentage of Canadians are considered Inuit; they make up 0.227% <br />
								of the total population or about 4% of the indigenous population.

									Indigenous people comprise larger percentages of the northern provinces, <br />
									making up more than half of the Nunavut and Northwest Territories <br /> 
									population compared to less than 10% of southern provinces such as Ontario and Nova Scotia. <br /> 
									The bulk of First Nations and Métis people live in the southern provinces, with First Nations communities centered around <br />
									Quebec and Ontario and Métis communities located more to the west in provinces such as Ontario and Alberta. <br />
									The Inuit population exists mainly to the east, especially in the northernmost province of Nunavut.

							Mental health shows a positive correlation with food insecurity in both males and females. <br />
							Indigenous groups in general have both higher food insecurity rates and worse mental health. <br />
							Of the indigenous groups, Métis communities show slightly lower food insecurity rates and <br />
							slightly better mental health in both genders. <br />
							The Inuit serve as an outlier in that they have much higher food insecurity rates than any other indigenous group, <br />
							yet are less likely to have poor mental health. <br />
							In general, males from all groups have less food insecurity and better mental health outcomes than females.<br />
